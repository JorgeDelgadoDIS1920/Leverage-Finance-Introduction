Speaker1: [00:00:01] Does Csam or Credit Suisse? Any questions, concerns? Comments, feedback? Anything. Do you guys want to do any introductions that maybe. Yeah, sure.

Speaker2: [00:00:13] We can go around the do a quick one. Probably want to kick it off okay. Yeah. So I, I responsible for what we call straight lending in in the US. So basically we have operations middle office [00:00:30] and ANZ for the lending businesses. So leverage finance and the rest of lending activity that we have here in Santander in the US. Sorry. That's me I'm Gonzalo, I'm responsible for all the projects related to leveraged finance globally. But our focus is mainly in the US probably. Nicolas Martinez, CEO of lending. Yes. Jeff Winston, business development.

Speaker3: [00:00:56] More on the trading side these days.

Speaker2: [00:00:59] And I'm [00:01:00] working closely with historians in the project management.

Speaker1: [00:01:07] Was traded for trading and we wish you a lot of those operations. Oh, good.

Speaker4: [00:01:16] Is there a lot of training and working with the external consultant on? Some of the people in the team are also simple.

Speaker2: [00:01:31] And [00:01:30] Pablo. Pablo.

Speaker1: [00:01:35] Pablo. Yeah.

Speaker2: [00:01:42] Oh. Yeah. The like Marilyn Monroe.

Speaker5: [00:01:48] Yeah. Abc finance.

Speaker4: [00:01:52] Yeah. And the other guys work with me in the in the in the team with Nico and and Gonzalo.

Speaker1: [00:01:59] Wait. Okay. [00:02:00] Why don't we begin? I think, Chris, I'm going to let you reserve. I think if we look at this is. I'll let you explain it. That's fine. So. So obviously we want to address any questions or areas of focus as we go through this. That's more interesting to you and your organization. So happy to to stop and talk about specific areas. One thing we like to highlight to, to potential customers as we're going through our process is identify, you know, why Virasana was stood up where we are today versus where we're going, and some of the [00:02:30] dynamics around how this enterprise even came together. And as you may be aware, with the consortium that was created mostly starting with JP Morgan and Bank of America and then expanding into the other members of of the, you know, nine Bank consortium, it was really to address some of the fundamental problems in the loan space. So as it relates to data, data dissemination how data is organized itself throughout the ecosystem. That was the mandate. That was the starting place. Then what we're highlighting here is [00:03:00] a representation of a loan transaction life cycle. So you're looking at this wheel box as one clockwise around to number seven. One being kind of underwriting or the kind of primary or the issuance of the loan. And all the way through its life cycle to ongoing risk management. You can see there hopefully box five with the dashes around it. That's the area where our mandate was focused. We had to start there because the data needed to be organized properly first to allow us to scale into these other areas. So [00:03:30] that's why, you know, JPM and Veeva mostly initially focused our attention in terms of our product development to address some of these fundamental critical areas in order to scale into other parts of the, of the, of the space.

Speaker1: [00:03:44] So that's servicing operations as you can maybe see there, you know you know, all of the relevant components that go into the core platform, essentially approximately 200 fields or so of data that we're representing out to out to customers. You know, resides in this this this section [00:04:00] we've already broken out of box five, if you will. We're now moved into box six. This is where lender reconciliation is now. Live. That went live in December. That just as an example of leveraging the data, leveraging the value propositions that are unique to persona into other parts of the loan space to help improve processes, modernize the space improve velocity of trading, ultimately in loans compressed settlement times from T plus 30 to something much more manageable. Remove [00:04:30] risk off of banks balance sheets. These are some of the issues, the fundamental issues that some of the large banks that started versona clearly care about. And then as we continue to, to move along, things like amendment voting or settlements or really anything else, data rooms for digital documentation for deals, all of these components are in scope for either through partnerships or development on our own. So just really to paint the picture of what is next or potentially next for this organization [00:05:00] and leverage the data and the access to real time information direct from agent bank systems of record, is really the core value prop that we're pushing out into the space. So I'll pause there just in case anybody has any questions on that. Hopefully that makes sense. But it's a good illustration of really what's involved in the space where we're starting and potentially where we head to next. Okay. Questions here.

Speaker2: [00:05:26] Sold again. Is this related just [00:05:30] to loan trading or any loan services.

Speaker1: [00:05:33] So so you are design is to transform the syndicated loan market. So so when we talk about syndicated loans it's really any loan that has more than one borrower. So as opposed to bilateral loans potentially that in the future as well. But that's kind of a different market altogether. So any type of syndication. So while we started in broadly syndicated it could be ABL so you know of various types. There actually are a few on the platform today, but the focus at the moment [00:06:00] is kind of broadly syndicated. But that also means private credit as well. So but it could go beyond that as we continue to evolve here. Thanks. Yeah. Any other questions or comments on that piece or that's generally straightforward. So so so again, persona as an organization is generally agnostic to the other platform of the platform, SaaS platforms, other providers that are out there. We're looking to work with a variety of participants and players in the space because as we sit here today, we're a data company, [00:06:30] a technology company, and our technology can be applied across the ecosystem to the various participants. So whether you're a lender, you're an agent, you're a service provider, you're a SaaS platform.

Speaker1: [00:06:41] So we're working closely with Advent Geneva as an accounting platform that Zach owns as an example to help some of our Buyside customers. So so it's really positioning ourselves to help as help as many parts of the ecosystem as as we can. But again, that may mean partnerships like we're doing with Zach in this example [00:07:00] or developing our own, you know, capabilities and products as we go forward. Like lender recon is the most recent example. Okay. One of the reasons for for coming on, you know, benefits coming on sooner versus later is that your voice gets heard. So Brendan comes to these meetings and we have weekly meetings or bi weekly meetings with customers, and we want their feedback. And so that that's driving where where we want to go to when he has that kind of information, you can go to our board members and say, now the banks are saying this [00:07:30] or this asset manager or these three asset managers are saying we need that. So it's. Is that fair to say it's like a yeah, it's like a few fewer voices fighting for attention and. Exactly.

Speaker6: [00:07:41] Making sure that you're getting your voice heard.

Speaker1: [00:07:42] Yeah. And that's happening kind of ongoing. Just, you know, anecdotally that, you know, from where I sit, you know, talking to a variety of customers that are dealing with, you know, certain parts of the space, whether it's two by side, you know, tier one asset managers to smaller asset managers, insurance companies to large tier one banks to, you know, smaller super [00:08:00] regionals or tier two players, everybody kind of has their own issues that they're trying to manage. And one of the things we hear from the buy side community as an example is we would love to get tax information, things that come off the the loan admin detail forms that we can represent on persona to ensure there's reconciliation for you, have the proper tax info or the proper, you know, tax rate, remittance information, other general info that's important to the buy side. So they don't have to keep querying their agents to say, oh, we submitted that form. You haven't updated [00:08:30] it in your system, or they only realize that there's an error when they're taxed at the wrong, you know, tax rate. And they're trying to get money back from the government, which here in the states is very difficult to do. I'm sure other places is the same. So there's those types of back and forth that we have from our customers. And the real thing to highlight here is and one of the major paradigm shifts, you know, from going into the market is connecting digitally into loan systems of record is a real change from how things have been done historically. So today, [00:09:00] everybody else gets data through PDFs, emails, faxes. You get on a distribution list, you send that information. It's processed either by yourself or a third party. And those third parties think of the service providers or other other companies, aggregate all this information together.

Speaker1: [00:09:17] They digitize it, which means printing it out, OCR, scanning it back into digitized form. They offshore it many times to be manually reconciled and then it's fit for purpose. So think of like a WSO file or [00:09:30] others. We as an organization are looking to disintermediate or remove that entire workflow. So now it's direct agent to lender of record digitally without any other intervening party. Manipulating the data, calculating the data. You know, many others in this space are taking global level information and applying that down pro-rata to the entities to the contract level, because they only want to process event notices at the global, because it's more expensive to do it down to the contract level. We [00:10:00] as an organization are getting the data digitally. So whether we're consuming 200 fields out of an IQ from all these agent banks or 300 fields or 400 fields, it's still data. Now it's just extra rows that we're consuming and producing. So we have the ability to scale and pull on a lot more granular data, which is important to our value prop than trying to get everything on a, you know, eight by ten, you know, form that gets faxed or emailed. So just wanted to highlight that, because that is a real distinction from what's happening today. And all the other providers [00:10:30] in the space today are only able to receive the data through the traditional methods, which is get on the loan admin detail, form somebody forward you something on email, PDF, or God forbid you still receive faxes. That's the way things are done today. So I know a lot of people are still receiving faxes, so I don't even know where you buy a fax machine, but it's still being processed, so.

Speaker2: [00:10:53] Our fax number from any. I mean, that's our first step.

Speaker1: [00:10:59] That's the first step. That's [00:11:00] about 50 years. So you got your money out of that machine?

Speaker2: [00:11:04] Yeah.

Speaker1: [00:11:05] That's right. I think one of your questions yesterday focused on the questions that came over was, you know, what kind of data. And I think, Chris, you can talk to. Yeah. No. Yeah. We this is one of the elements on the back of that call that we had yesterday just to highlight, you know, what types of data are out there. So this was just a quick slide. Clearly it's not all inclusive, but just to give you an idea of what's involved. So main three main elements position impacting events cash [00:11:30] flow events lifecycle events. So you can see you know the different levels of information available. So clearly facility level or global level information, we're clearly processing that as well in addition to contract level details. So at the entity or contract level we're processing all that information at the same time in real time. So whether you're a fund that's expecting some type of allocation, you're a CLO at a large asset manager, being able to reconcile that the position was put into the proper CLO and not into a very [00:12:00] similar, you know, CLO and being able to track that ongoing is definitely helpful from a operations and ongoing management perspective. And then things like cash flow events, as you can see, their principal and interest, ongoing fee payments, one time payments, drawdowns, unscheduled events. So so the real distinction just to highlight again is from a data perspective, in my mind it's similar to data arbitrage. So whether you have data on a timely basis or you don't have complete data on a timely basis, if [00:12:30] that's the right word, it's really having information sooner than than others having it in real time versus waiting days, potentially after an event effective date before you even see the information, because it takes that long to be processed.

Speaker1: [00:12:42] So that's the real departure that really manifests itself, particularly for the for the training side of the conversation, for things that are unscheduled. So an unscheduled drawdown, unscheduled prepay something's trading at 9495 in the market. Somebody prepays at par a large chunk of it. You're still trading that or making a market in that name. [00:13:00] Not knowing for three more days that there's an actual unscheduled event that occurred. Whereas the buy side who was on site and this is an actual example, came to us and said, this is happening, but large, you know, agent, you know, is still making the same market. Are they aware that this prepaid, you know, one of our investor banks or one of the nines. You can figure it out. And they said the trading desk did not have that information. Parts of their organization did but the trading desk didn't know it. So that's just an example of how data getting you [00:13:30] to sooner or more complete is definitely beneficial across an organization. So we're seeing that manifest itself today in the space. So any questions or comments on that. That's pretty self-explanatory.

Speaker5: [00:13:45] Let's go back to the agenda. Sure.

Speaker1: [00:13:50] So the outputs you know, we can certainly talk about I know that, you know, the POC and just to kind of level set expectations for their or showcase what is available through the proof of [00:14:00] concept what that three month trial entitles you to. So it can definitely provide some overviews there. And then certainly want to open it up for for your questions and focus on areas that are more interesting to you. So today we offer a three month trial. So we call it an evaluation agreement. So that's the document that was being reviewed. And hopefully is is good to go. That essentially allows customers to trial the platform in production, seeing production data for for three months. The way that customers consume data from us today are [00:14:30] two ways through the UI, which is the user interface where people go to consume data versus the API connectivity. Api connectivity is reserved for subscription customers because there is a bit of a onboarding for that piece. The UI, which is for the three month trial, is a very light lift. From a technical perspective, it's really just setting up your entity identifier.

Speaker1: [00:14:51] So we use CEI. So entity identifier and essentially it's all the agent banks turning on the data for year 1 or 2 entities. I [00:15:00] think it's just one entity here in the US that all the all the loans reside in. And once that's turned on all of the data flows and you're able to see your information directly on the UI within basically a week or two, and that really depends on scheduling for training, enabling users, getting credentialed for users to access the platform. So it's really that level of kind of integration work, which is pretty low to access the data. And that's really what happens over the next three months. There's implementation and support teams [00:15:30] that work with customers on an ongoing basis with weekly calls to ensure that, you know, the data is understood, the fields are understood, you know, if there's any issues logging in and all those normal Potential questions. So that's really how simple ultimately the evaluation process is in terms of setup. And that runs for a three month period to to hopefully go over a quarter end to see data from from that perspective.

Speaker2: [00:15:55] One question to check from my perspective, the coverage, [00:16:00] how we would connect in the future what kind of information is there, blah blah blah. What I understand is not covered by this agreement. Yeah. So we need to have a separate agreement to check that.

Speaker1: [00:16:14] You mean for the API connectivity or.

Speaker2: [00:16:16] Not to connect per se, but for the analysis to.

Speaker1: [00:16:20] I think there's an NDA within this evaluation agreement, which probably does. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm my understanding probably covers the API. [00:16:30] I know we're working with our team to create because we've had others ask about APIs. So I think what we're trying to do is create something that we can distribute.

Speaker2: [00:16:39] Some documentation.

Speaker1: [00:16:40] Some documentation that gives you the answer. So we do have that. So. So once the NDA is signed I think it's much easier to kind of share some of that more technical documentation for customers. So so we do have more of a I wouldn't call it a white paper necessarily, but it's an overview document specific to the API conversation about what the payloads look like, [00:17:00] what type of information, some sample outputs, looking at the screen and comparing what it means from an API perspective, because ultimately that mapping exercise would then ultimately happen with our 200 plus fields. You want to map it into your database or wherever systems need to consume it. So we can certainly start to talk about those elements. You know, once we have an NDA in place that makes it easier.

Speaker7: [00:17:23] So I haven't been in a previous conversations.

Speaker4: [00:17:26] With the API, how are we going to receive information with this three month period. [00:17:30]

Speaker1: [00:17:31] Through the UI? So you see it through this visually and you can extract it out of there to Excel. But that's obviously not a long term solution. So, so the API piece allows you so that gets essentially turned on when you're a subscriber. But we can do work in advance to showcase what the samples look like. Provide sample messages so you can see how it's going to be ingested into your system or into your database. And see the type.

Speaker2: [00:17:57] Of definitely we're not going to develop a connection or [00:18:00] anything, I just want to plan. So that's the POC if we want to go. So this is a three month, six month project and we need to know those.

Speaker1: [00:18:08] And I know we've done in the past sample extracts. So you can see what the messages look like. So we, we can we can work with our, our tech folks to help provide to answer those questions or provide you samples. But we don't have a sandbox environment per se to allow customers to go in and consume yet. But there's ways we can assist. So you can kind of understand the scoping [00:18:30] for the effort.

Speaker5: [00:18:32] Once you're turned on. We're generating those notices from the outbound anyway. Obviously the connectivity and everything else that's not within the USA. But I think what we've done before is like we can share some of those samples in production so you can see what they actually look like to match them up versus the data. You're getting.

Speaker1: [00:18:48] To.

Speaker5: [00:18:48] Compare.

Speaker1: [00:18:49] What you're seeing on the UI versus what the API version looks like, to calibrate that in your potential.

Speaker5: [00:18:55] And just ask the question ahead.

Speaker3: [00:18:57] Of time, given where we are in our journey and that this business [00:19:00] didn't exist a year ago and we're so we're scaling and growing in real time, which is, you know, turning out to be a good problem to have. But how much wiggle room is there out of the three months we need more customers?

Speaker1: [00:19:11] I mean, the ultimate goal there is to see the data, you know, to use the data to get the value out of it. Clearly we don't want you to sit in the waiting room indefinitely. Right? So, so, but but certainly want to work with customers to make sure it's useful to your process.

Speaker5: [00:19:25] You can see who's.

Speaker1: [00:19:27] Using it and others who are like, you know, if you log in once [00:19:30] in three months and then come back at the end of the third month, you're like, hey, can we have an.

Speaker5: [00:19:33] Extension?

Speaker1: [00:19:34] It's harder for us to go back to our management team and like say, hey, give me an extra next month. But when you have people, you know, you have 20 people logged in. It's hard to refute, like these guys are using it. They just have.

Speaker5: [00:19:44] A.

Speaker1: [00:19:45] A process that longer than most. Like like most banks take forever. We get the one question we did have is we were hoping you were the one exception. Exactly. But one do. One question though, is for the [00:20:00] to do the evaluation. Do you also subsequently have to do the third third party onboarding process first or can that be done?

Speaker2: [00:20:10] So yeah, we've done onboarding of of the vendor assets with you guys as well.

Speaker5: [00:20:14] Oh yeah.

Speaker2: [00:20:15] Okay. We've done in a in the lightest possible way, assuming that we're doing this first stage of because obviously there's going to be a much heavier onboarding if we go into the API connectivity, because then we're going to share data. [00:20:30] You're going to consume that.

Speaker5: [00:20:33] Yeah.

Speaker2: [00:20:33] It's going to be a lot of many, many, many other elements, but I think this is the first stage. So we can get kick off with this in this space. It's done. That doesn't mean that we don't have a learn. Again, the learning journey is still on. If we move on on the subscription service, specifically onboarding the vendor, and I think that's what's done on the onboarding. The service then is different, isn't it? Yeah.

Speaker3: [00:20:56] So just to ask the question expressly because I think this was on our list is so [00:21:00] this like this evaluation period, acknowledging that there probably will have to be some some time on, on on maybe perhaps for people on your side working with us. I just want is there any cost associated with not.

Speaker5: [00:21:13] No requirements.

Speaker1: [00:21:13] Or no cost. And it's really again, just to showcase the data to make it as useful as possible. And the ultimate goal is to showcase the difference of what's available via persona versus not. So we certainly want people trained and using it, and we don't really start the clock, if you will, until all the users are trained [00:21:30] and have gone through that kind of onboarding process to make sure that, you know, three months is a useful time useful time period. And if it's not, we certainly work with customers to to address it. The one thing just to highlight in terms of being onboarded customers come on banks now specifically. Typically come on not all the time, but typically come on as a lender first. So because because you mentioned the part about receiving data versus also sending data. So from a bank's perspective or really anyone data outbound from the organization is a much [00:22:00] more, you know, heavier lift, much more scrutiny versus taking data inbound. Right. So a lot of customers, particularly banks come on as a lender first. So they're just receiving data from us when they want to bring on their agency business. That's usually a few months after once all of the API's are set up the process is well understood. Now they're ready to bring on their agency. That doesn't happen all the time. That's happened a lot so far. So just to be aware you can come on first as a lender process that get all the technology [00:22:30] set up, then decide we're ready to bring our agency business on and then sending data outbound has its own requirements.

Speaker2: [00:22:36] Okay, I've been in that conversation already with the vendor teams and said, okay, what are you going to do? I said, okay, let's talk. We can actually have that conversation. Let's say we're saying, I'm just consuming data. I'm not sharing my that's.

Speaker1: [00:22:50] What a document is. That's the subscription agreement, which is the consumption of data only.

Speaker2: [00:22:55] Absolutely. I mean, that's that's precisely it. There's no connectivity. So there's no way we can share data. So [00:23:00] it's it's out of scope right now, but it will become. And then yes, they're facing we need to see once we see the data that it's there. Who is there and so on. We see where we see more benefit and we anticipate more benefits from the lender perspective. But you know, we need to understand that better and see on the agency side that we have also there's any, any value on on starting from day one with agency. Also floating seven cyber security [00:23:30] perspective. Getting data is not the same as selling out. So the requirements would be much heavier. So maybe it makes sense to place the approach even from that point of view.

Speaker1: [00:23:40] And that's what a lot to so so there's no requirement to do them both at the same time. You can do them separately. Ultimately that subscription agreement gets replaced by something called an MSA, which is the piece that encompasses both agency and lender together. And that can be, you know, six months forward. That could be a year forward. There's no requirement. So coming on as a lender satisfies, you know, everything [00:24:00] required. And then you can decide when and if you do agency in the future. So just just to kind of highlight that. So so any other questions on the evaluation period that you guys had the POC that everyone thought?

Speaker4: [00:24:15] Yeah, it would be looking at production data.

Speaker1: [00:24:18] Collect your data. So generally speaking, I think we give access to ten users. If you need more than ten, I'm sure you just start with a number, [00:24:30] but you let us know what's required. We'll figure that out. Yeah. You can always add more smoke.

Speaker2: [00:24:39] Okay.

Speaker1: [00:24:40] Yeah. The other benefit of being a customer in the evaluation stage, you can talk to some of our board members, people who have gone through this process. They'll help you, give you guidance. This is what we did. This is the things that we experience. Here are the pitfalls. Here are the things that worked well. So there's been a lot of you know, JPM has been very [00:25:00] helpful and so forth. So you'll have access to those types of resources as well. Yeah. And specifically on the STP or treaty processing components. Clearly that's a big you know, longer term goal for many customers who are coming on the platform is to be able to do automated workflow, bringing it into the organization once, bring it into a centralized database, data lake, data warehouse, whatever ultimately it is, and being able to facilitate the [00:25:30] workflows that hang off of that database as an example. So to prevent data from being rekeyed into multiple systems, to avoid multiple you know, human intervention points, it's allowing the data to move seamlessly across an organization. That's the straight through processing. Gpm and have been announced last year, they highlighted that they achieved that in their loan operations. So they've been vocal to us about willingness, and maybe you guys have talked to them already in some capacity to talk to customers about those best practices, what they've learned, [00:26:00] what worked for them. And clearly they're doing it at scale. Within their organizations. So happy to provide that those contacts, that discussion for best practices, at least on the STP side. As you're going through your analysis.

Speaker4: [00:26:14] I have also a very good question because I'm just coming up to speed on your functionality. So it's our production data based on who is the agent that you have ordered or service.

Speaker1: [00:26:28] So ultimately it's ultimately [00:26:30] it's the agents data. So it's coming out of their systems of record.

Speaker4: [00:26:33] So these days you also have you only have so far JPM.

Speaker1: [00:26:37] No, no there's there's I don't know if you have the front page. No no no no. So let's be specific okay. Currently we have JP Morgan Bank of America, almost 100% of their US dollar.

Speaker4: [00:26:49] Based interface on any of the deals with that data. Yes.

Speaker1: [00:26:54] Yes, with the revolvers and term loans.

Speaker4: [00:26:57] Okay.

Speaker1: [00:26:58] We are bringing on [00:27:00] LCS winning couple of revolvers on the platform right now, but we're bringing on the.

Speaker3: [00:27:04] Letter of credit.

Speaker1: [00:27:05] Activity as well.

Speaker3: [00:27:07] Now they're actually doing.

Speaker1: [00:27:07] The development will be.

Speaker3: [00:27:08] Done by JP, will be done by March. And Bank of America is there on.

Speaker1: [00:27:12] Yeah.

Speaker4: [00:27:13] Okay.

Speaker1: [00:27:13] So you'll have those Wells Fargo I'm thinking 80% of their.

Speaker3: [00:27:18] Their a high percentage.

Speaker1: [00:27:19] On high percentage. I don't know the exact we've got Citigroup who's put on. Yeah. So yes. So city has things on. They're going through a loan IQ integration [00:27:30] slash partnering partnership with the US government. So they're now allowing them to put their data to loan IQ. So they've gotten the go ahead. So we're starting to see those deals start to populate. Once it gets into the low IQ environment it's going to be released. So really the remaining ones so DBMs and city are coming on call it Q2 or most of their deals should should be on end of Q2. And then Barclays is the newest to the group. So they came on in September. They started as [00:28:00] a subscription agreement as well as what I was describing, and they're going to start bringing their deals on on the beginning of the year, middle of the year. They're going to start that process to start onboarding their deals as well. But it's going to be the same.

Speaker2: [00:28:13] For the other four. It's like beginning to end.

Speaker1: [00:28:16] I would say through Q2, just because they have their own brand schedules and.

Speaker4: [00:28:20] You're going.

Speaker3: [00:28:22] To have to go.

Speaker1: [00:28:23] Through their their deals and.

Speaker3: [00:28:24] Make sure the quality.

Speaker1: [00:28:24] Is.

Speaker3: [00:28:25] Out there, because they might take shortcuts in IQ or the Where do we have to handle things and discover new deals, or scrubbing the data before we [00:28:30] start publishing it? So you don't have to go back to it or revisit it for any concerns.

Speaker2: [00:28:33] So it's just to understand what data we're going to see.

Speaker1: [00:28:37] Yeah, I mean, so so just in terms of scale, JPMorgan and, you know, Bank of America, probably 4 or 5 times the total number of deals that some of these others. So we would expect them to get their populations on within a couple of months, you know, give or take all things going well. So that's why we say Q2 just to give some runway for it. But that's what's anticipated today. That's the plans that they've put forth to us. They're [00:29:00] coming out of now and starting cities already in production. It's just more of ramping the extra deals. And then Morgan Stanley and DB are coming to start ramping pretty soon in February this month. So so that's why we give Q2 as a, you know, a little bit of a runway. They may outperform it sooner.

Speaker4: [00:29:20] But yeah. So I mean that's if we don't see a train that we need, we don't chase Because they don't have the percentage. That's right.

Speaker1: [00:29:29] That gives you [00:29:30] the biggest challenges from from who's not on this list.

Speaker4: [00:29:33] But the issue.

Speaker1: [00:29:38] That comes to mind. So so I talked about the tax for a minute. So so the remaining two US kind of tier ones that we're working with are Goldman Sachs and Jefferies. So so those are the two remaining ones. Goldman Sachs has actually picked up quite dramatically over the last couple of months. So without saying too much about what we're doing with them, what's moving in that direction. So ultimately the goal is to have them [00:30:00] on the platform, both as a lender, as an agent. They're motivated to do it. They they dabbled with another provider talking about other providers in this meeting. And now they're moving. You know, I'm not sure who that is, but but yes. And they're they're now moving in a different direction. And they'll probably still have that relationship as well. So not to say anything about that provider, but the distinction ultimately with that provider without naming them and
